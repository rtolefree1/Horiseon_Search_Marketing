## User Story


```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements 
    added to HTML file:
      [x] section element
      [x] header element
      [x] footer element
      [x] remove div header class
      [x] remove div footer class
      [x] removed un-necessary divs
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    updated CSS files:
    <dl>
      [x] classes benefit-lead, benefit-brand, benefit-cost to one class : benefit-lead-brand-cost
      [x] classes search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-management, social-media-marketing to one class : search-online-social
    </dl>
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
     added
      [x] alt to link areas, and image areas
      [x] alt's contain descriptions
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
     added
      [x] Updated footer head to h4
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
     added
      [x] updated title to "Marketing"
```
